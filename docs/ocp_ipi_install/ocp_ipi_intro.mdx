# OCP IPI Introduction

OCP Installer Provisioned Installation (IPI) was released in August 2022. It gives customer a intutive and easy way to deploy OCP cluster on Nutanix AOS.

In this lab we will go through the steps of deploying OCP cluster using IPI.

:::info

Estimated time to complete this whole lab is **60 minutes** including OCP cluster deployment.

The OCP cluster deployment will take up to **30 minutes** once started.

:::info Setting expectations

Although it might seem like a lot of work for IPI, the aim of the lab is to take you through the one-time process a customer would go through. Once pre-requisites are set once, customers can deploy as many number of OCP clusters.

You could also explore automating these one time pre-requisites preparation tasks using automation frameworks like Nutanix **NCM**.

:::note References

We have referred to the following documents for building this lab:
- [Nutanix Dev - IPI on Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.dev/2022/08/16/red-hat-openshift-ipi-on-nutanix-cloud-platform)

## Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites are necessary:

- Prism Central - at least **pc.2022.4.0.2**
- AOS - at least **5.20.4**
- Access to RedHat Console to download the following    
  - Pull secret
  - IPI installation binaries
  - Openshift access tools (oc, kubectl)
  - Cloud Credential Operator (CCOCTL) utility  binaries
- An SSL certificate for Prism Central signed by a Certification Authority (we will also create certificates in this lab)
- Networking requirements
  - AHV IPAM Network (your HPOC already has this)
  - DNS server (Windows AutoAD VM is pre-deployed for DNS capabilities)
  - Static IP addresses in your AHV IPAM network for OCP's api and apps endpoints 

## High Level Plan

1. Prepare pre-requiisites
   - Preparing LinuxToolsVM - as a OCP provisioning VM
   - Preparing HPOC cluster - AHV Networking and DNS
   - Installing OCP tools 
2. Prepare and install SSL certificate for Prism Central
3. Creating OCP IPI installation manifest files  
4. Installing OCP cluster and first login

:::note

During the OCP cluster installation, a ``OCP bootstrap VM`` will be created and be deleted upon a successful OCP cluster creation.

This bootstrapVM does most of the install function.

We can now move on to the setting up pre-requisites section.
