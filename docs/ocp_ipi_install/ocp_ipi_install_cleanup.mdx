## Deploying OCP Cluster  

This will be simplest part of all, provided you have done everything correctly to this point. 

1. Start the installation of OCP cluster by executing the following

    ```mdx-code-block
    <BrowserWindow>
    <details>
    <summary>Do you need more details about installation?</summary>
    <div>
    <body>
 
    ```bash 
    nohup openshift-install create cluster --log-level=debug &
    ```
    ```bash title="Now you can follow the nohup logs to see installation progress"
    tail -f nohup.out
    ```
    </body>
    </div>
    </details>
    </BrowserWindow>
 
    ```bash 
    nohup openshift-install create cluster &
    ```

2. A typical installation flow would look like this

   ```buttonless {16,18} title="Install output - note the access information to the OCP cluster"
   openshift-install create cluster

   INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run

   INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local 
   INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" 
   INFO Time elapsed: 27m0s
   ```
3. Once the installation is done we can access OCP cluster using the following ways:
   
    <Tabs groupId="Login Method">
    <TabItem value="kubeconfig file" label="kubeconfig">

    ```text title="Export your kubeconfig file to env"
    export KUBECONFIG=/root/xyz/auth/kubeconfig
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kubeadmin credentials" label="kubeadmin">

    ```text title="Make sure to use your password"
    oc login -u kubeadmin -p xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
   
   ```bash
   oc get nodes
   ##
   NAME                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
   xyz-6zlwh-master-0       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   xyz-6zlwh-master-1       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   xyz-6zlwh-master-2       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   xyz-6zlwh-worker-czbn7   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   xyz-6zlwh-worker-njv66   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   xyz-6zlwh-worker-mlgbh   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
   ```

   Through the OCP GUI using kubeadmin credentials

   From your UserXX-WindowsToolsPC, open Chrome

   Open the following URL
   
   ```url
   https://console-openshift-console.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   ```
   ![](images/ipi-installed-cluster.png)
   
   You have sucessfully installed OCP using IPI.

## Cleanup (optional)

Run through the following if you would like to delete the OCP cluster. This step is optional for HPOC as it resets at the  end of reservation.


1. In your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 

2. Change to you working directory that we created before (if not there already)

   ```bash
   cd /root/xyz
   ```

3. Clean up with the following command:

   ```bash
   openshift-install destroy cluster 
   ```

   ```buttonless title="Output"

   ```
   
IPI installation method is simple and consistent to deploy as after the pre-rquisites are setup once. 

Customers can easily deploy as many OCP clusters on Nutanix HCI.
